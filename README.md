# Password-Generator
So here's a password generator.
In order to begin you have to push the generate password button.
Then it's gong to prompt you if you want to generate a password.
Then it's going to ask how many characters would you like your password to be.
If you choose a number below 8 or a number above 128 its going to reinerate that the password has be between 8-128 characters long.
Then it's going to ask if you want lowercase characters.
Then it's going to ask if you want uppercase characters.
Then it's going to ask if you want numbers.
And lastly if you want special characters.
Once you've made all these selections your password will be generated.


ps.....I couldnt figure out how to remove the coma's with the final password generate. I removed the coma's from my array but it still kept showing up for the final result.
